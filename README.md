# GDwGBtBGD
Sourcecode to some early version of GDwGBtBGD

Here's the source to some old version of [GDwGBtBGD](https://tucker-slack.itch.io/gdwgbtbgd-gdko25). I believe this is from right after the first pGDKO (post "[Game Dev Knock-Out](https://itch.io/jam/gdko-2025-round-1)" jam ), 
which was a bit before the first "major" update-- by this game's standards.
